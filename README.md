# Hi.
Currently, I'm building [Arkay](https://arkay.app/) - an integrated workspace for communication and collaboration. It is a virtual space that combines the dynamics of a chat app with the efficiency of a text editor, providing a more complete experience for individuals and organizations.

I talk a little more about the platform in a post on Tabnews. Acess [here](https://www.tabnews.com.br/filipeogr/pitch-arkay-comunicacao-e-colaboracao-para-o-dia-a-dia)

Arkay is a personal project. It is not associated with any external organizations or people. If you're interested in becoming a member of the Arkay team or investing in the project, you can reach me via email or on X (Twitter).

## Experiences
In my last job, I worked at an internal startup of a company authorized by Heineken, developing solutions for internal teams such as the commercial sector, logistics management, and leadership solutions. Besides development, I was responsible for architecting the layout/UI of the solutions, acting as a *Design Engineer*.

The majority of my experience in programming is with technologies and tools from the *JavaScript ecosystem*, but I also have experience with other languages, like *Python* and *Java*.

Before software development, I had a background in maintenance, specifically the maintenance of *mechanical equipment* and *onboard electronic systems*. I worked as a member of the *Clinical Engineering* team at a large hospital in Brazil.
