# Hi.

Currently, I'm building on [Arkay](https://arkay.app/) - an integrated workspace for communication and collaboration. It is a virtual space that combines the dynamics of a chat app with the efficiency of a text editor, providing a more complete experience for individuals and organizations.

I talk a little more about the platform in a post on Tabnews. Acess [here](https://www.tabnews.com.br/filipeogr/pitch-arkay-comunicacao-e-colaboracao-para-o-dia-a-dia)

Arkay is a personal project. It is not associated with any external organizations or people. If you're interested in becoming a member of the Arkay team or investing in the project, you can reach me via email or on X (Twitter).
