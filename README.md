## Experience

In my last job, I worked at an internal startup of a company authorized by Heineken, developing solutions for internal teams, such as the commercial sector, logistics management, and leadership solutions. We used ReactJS, NodeJs, Prisma, Styled-Components, Yup, and other libraries. Additionally, we used Python to run some scripts.

Besides development, I was responsible for architecting and implementing the layout/UI of the solutions, acting as a *Design Engineer*. I mainly used Figma for prototyping but also utilized AdobeXD.

The majority of my experience in programming is with technologies and tools from the *JavaScript ecosystem*, but I also have experience with other languages, like *Python* and *Java*.

## Background

Before transitioning to software development, I gained experience in the maintenance of hospital equipment, which included mechanical equipment and embedded electronic systems. I was a member of the Clinical Engineering team at a large hospital in Brazil.
