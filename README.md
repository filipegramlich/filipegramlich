# Hi.

Currently, I'm building [Arkay](https://arkay.app/) - an integrated workspace for communication and collaboration. It is a virtual space that combines the dynamics of a chat app with the efficiency of a text editor, providing a more complete experience for individuals and organizations.

I am using NextJS, NodeJs, Tailwind, TipTap, Supabase, among other technologies and platforms.

I talk a little more about the platform in a post on Tabnews. Acess [here](https://www.tabnews.com.br/filipeogr/pitch-arkay-comunicacao-e-colaboracao-para-o-dia-a-dia)

Arkay is a personal project. It is not associated with any external organizations or people. If you're interested in becoming a member of the Arkay team or investing in the project, you can reach me via email or on X (Twitter).

## Experience

In my last job, I worked at an internal startup of a company authorized by Heineken, developing solutions for internal teams, such as the commercial sector, logistics management, and leadership solutions. We used ReactJS, NodeJs, Prisma, Styled-Components, Yup, and other libraries. Additionally, we used Python to run some scripts.

Besides development, I was responsible for architecting and implementing the layout/UI of the solutions, acting as a *Design Engineer*. I mainly used Figma for prototyping but also utilized AdobeXD.

The majority of my experience in programming is with technologies and tools from the *JavaScript ecosystem*, but I also have experience with other languages, like *Python* and *Java*.

## Background

Before transitioning to software development, I gained experience in the maintenance of hospital equipment, which included mechanical equipment and embedded electronic systems. I was a member of the Clinical Engineering team at a large hospital in Brazil.
